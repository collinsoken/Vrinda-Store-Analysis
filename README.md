## Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from Vrinda Store to provide actionable insights. The raw data file, *Vrinda_store_aw_data*, contained unstructured and inconsistent information. Through extensive data cleaning and analysis, the transformed dataset in *Vrinda Store Data Cleaned and Analyzed* serves as the foundation for creating meaningful dashboards and reports.

## Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: Address inconsistencies, errors, and missing values in the raw dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Extract key metrics and trends relevant to Vrinda Store's operations.
- **Dashboard Creation**: Develop interactive Excel dashboards for visualizing insights.


## Execution Summary

### **Data Cleaning**

The raw data was processed to ensure accuracy, consistency, and usability. Key cleaning tasks included:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Check and handle missing entries using appropriate methods such as imputation or removal based on context.
- **Standardizing Formats**: Unified date formats, currency values, and text entries for consistency across the dataset.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate entries to avoid skewed analysis.
- **Correcting Errors**: Fixed typographical errors and mismatched categories in the raw data.


### **Exploratory Data Analysis**

After cleaning, the dataset was analyzed to uncover valuable insights to answer the following key business question:

- **Compare the sales and orders using single chart**
- **Which month got the highest sales and orders**?
- **Who purchased more- men or women in 2022**?
- **What are different order status in 2022**?
- **What are the top 5 states contributing to the sales**?
- **What is the relationship between age and gender based on number of orders**?
- **Which channel is contributing to maximum sales**?
- **Which is the highest selling category**?
- **What is the average customer age**?

### **Techniques employed included:**

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated measures for key variables.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identified patterns over time (e.g., sales performance by month).
- **Segmentation**: Grouped data by categories like product category, channel, and region to understand performance drivers.
- **Pivot Tables**: Used pivot tables to summarize large datasets efficiently.


### **Dashboard Creation**

Interactive dashboards were designed to present insights visually. Features of the dashboard include:

- **Dynamic Charts**: Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and other visuals to represent trends.
- **Filters and Slicers**: Enabled users to drill down into specific segments of data.
- **KPIs Display**: Highlighted key performance indicators such as total sales, average order value, average customer age, etc.


### **Approach**

1. **Structured Workflow**:
    - Imported raw data into Excel.
    - Applied systematic cleaning techniques using formulas
    - Conducted exploratory analysis using Excel pivot tables.
2. **Visualization Best Practices**:
    - Used color coding for clarity.
    - Ensured dashboards were user-friendly with intuitive navigation.


## Insights & Recommendations
The sales data highlights strong performance among specific customer segments and regions, offering valuable direction for strategic growth. *Women* are the primary buyers, accounting for 64% of total sales, indicating a clear opportunity to further tailor product offerings, marketing campaigns, and user experiences toward this demographic.

Additionally, the dominance of sales from *Maharashtra*, *Karnataka*, and *Uttar Pradesh* (70% combined) suggests that these regions should remain a focal point for targeted promotions, localized advertising, and logistical optimization.

The *Set* category is the dominant category for products sold in the store. This shows a high interest from customers in Set products, which indicates a clear opportunity for optimizing marketing campaigns, narrowing down customer preferences and exploring more product offerings in this categories.  

The *Adult* and *Young Adult* groups are the main contributors to both Women’s and Men’s categories, representing over 75% of sales. This demographic alignment should guide product design, seasonal collections, and influencer partnerships to better resonate with their preferences and lifestyle.

Finally, with 80% of sales driven through *Amazon, *Flipkart*, and *Myntra* —particularly *Amazon* at 35% —it’s essential to strengthen these partnerships. Optimizing product visibility, enhancing customer reviews, running exclusive deals, and leveraging platform-specific ad tools can significantly boost conversion rates.

**Key Strategies to Improve Sales**:
- Prioritize Women-Centric Product Development & Marketing.
- Expand regional targeting in top-performing states with localized campaigns.
- Focus branding and promotions on Adult and Young Adult buyers with special focus on Set products.
- Maximize presence and performance on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra through targeted advertising, reviews management, and strategic pricing.

By aligning efforts with these insights, the store can unlock further growth and strengthen its market position.
